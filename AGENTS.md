## 🧠 Project: Futuristic “Learning” Landing Page

This file outlines the responsibilities and execution plan for the AI agent assigned to create an immersive, interactive landing page simulating a machine learning process. The page will act as a temporary placeholder during the development of a larger AI chatbot project.

---

## 👤 Assigned Agent Role

**Agent Name:** `sai`  
**Purpose:** Build a futuristic, interactive landing page that communicates "AI in training" while collecting user feedback.

---

## 🗂️ Primary Objectives

1. **Design a futuristic user interface** with sci-fi and machine learning aesthetics.
2. **Display core messages** indicating the AI is still learning.
3. **Include hover-activated animations** that visually represent machine or robot learning.
4. **Implement a user feedback form** to simulate user participation in the AI’s learning.
5. **Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility** across devices and input types.
6. **Deliver source code and a working preview** for testing and review.

## ✅ Task Breakdown

### 1. UI Design

- Use a **dark theme** with neon accents (colors: blue, purple, teal).
- Style the interface like a sci-fi dashboard or neural net console.
- Fonts: Prefer `Orbitron` or `Rajdhani` (Google Fonts).

---

### 2. Core Text Elements

- Display message:
  > **“I am learning. I’ll be ready soon.”**
  
- Subtext:
  > *“Leave your feedback to help me learn better.”*

- Text should appear as part of the UI—like system prompts.

---

### 3. Animation (Hover-Triggered)

- Trigger animations via `hover` or `mousemove` events.
- Visual concepts:
  - Gears turning
  - Neural nodes lighting up
  - Circuits activating
- Tools:
  - **SVG animations**
  - **Lottie (Bodymovin)** for JSON animations
  - **Three.js** for 3D (optional)

---

### 4. Feedback Collection

- UI Elements:
  - Multiline **textarea**
  - **Submit button** labeled "Send Feedback"

- Behavior:
  - On submit: store feedback in memory (or log to console)
  - Show confirmation message:  
    > *“Thanks! Your feedback has been received.”*

- Code should be **modular**, allowing future integration with:
  - Firebase
  - Supabase
  - Node.js backend

---

### 5. Responsiveness & Accessibility

- Responsive layout for:
  - Desktop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile

- Accessibility checklist:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Keyboard support
  - High contrast elements

---

### 6. Technical Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML5  
  - TailwindCSS  
  - JavaScript

- **Animations:**  
  - Lottie  
  - SVG/CSS  
  - Optional: Three.js, WebGL, GSAP

---

### 7. Optional Features

- **Background effects:**
  - Particle system (Particles.js or tsParticles)
  - Glowing circuits / matrix code
  
- **Typewriter effect** for main message (optional but preferred)

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- ✅ A working demo
- ✅ Source code:
- ✅ Clean code structure:
  - Reusable components
  - Modular layout
  - Comments and documentation included

---

## 📌 Final Notes

This landing page will serve as a **temporary, engaging placeholder** while the chatbot system is being finalized. It should give visitors the impression that something powerful is being trained and developed — and invite them to be part of the process through feedback.

Once complete, the agent should **notify project stakeholders** and **submit deliverables** for review.
